# My solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2020

Last year, I did only the 10 first days of https://adventofcode.com/2019

This year, I find the exercises more interesting and I hope I will continue untill the end. Exercises are simple enough to be solved quickly (less than 1 hour for 2 exercises), but complex enough to force creativity and hard thinking (for example the 10b or the 13b).

I program in Perl. In order to code faster, I put fewer comments and I use shorter identifiers than I would at work. I try to use constructions that are the less error prone to reduce debugging time. I think the need for speed favours a good balance between simplicity and concision.

I am proud of the "the perlish style" of many of my solutions. I think someone learning perl could try to solve the exercises by himself, then look at my solutions to compare. If you find your solution more elegant, I welcome your feedback.

I am learning javascript. I will try to solve some of the exercise using javascript. As I am a beginner, all feedback is welcome.
